Dubious Dynamics: Robot Decision Making Under Uncertainty

Authors: Vincent Chow, Ian de Vlaming, Tori Fujinami

Main project files:

simulation.jl
	- main file, simulations run from here for any of the 3 algorithms and 2 state space models
POMDP_lite.jl
	- setup file for POMDP-lite
QMDP_setup.jl
	- setup file for QMDP
SSM.jl
	- contains point mass and car state space model

The authors thank Patrick Slade and Preston Culbertson for sharing the base code structure for running simulations and for the standard POMDP setup files.
